Sebastiano Vascon is an assistant professor (RTDb) at Ca' Foscari University of Venice at the Department of Environmental Sciences, Computer Science and Statistics (DAIS). He is also affiliated to the European Centre for Living Technology and the Italian Institute of Technology.

In May 2016 he obtained the title of Ph.D. from the Italian Institute of Technology and the University of Genoa, with a thesis on evolutionary game theory applied in the context of pattern analysis and computer vision. During the doctorate period, he has focused his efforts on the detection of conversational groups to improve video surveillance systems and in the study of brain connectomics for the automatic analysis of neuronal connections between the hemispheres. 

Currently, his research interests are focused on the automatic analysis of patterns, computer vision, machine learning and graph theory using models inspired by the game theory. Recently he found a renewed interest in neural networks (mainly deep-learning) and learning problems with contextual constraint.
