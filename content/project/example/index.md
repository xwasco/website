The physical reconstruction of shattered artworks is one of the most labour-intensive steps in archaeological research. Dug out from excavation sites are countless ancient artefacts, such as vases, amphoras and frescoes, that are damaged. The EU-funded RePAIR project will facilitate the reconstruction process to bring ancient artworks back to life. Specifically, it will develop an intelligent robotic system that can autonomously process, match and physically assemble large fractured artefacts in a fraction of the time required by humans. This new system will be tested on iconic case studies from the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Pompeii. It will restore two world-renowned frescoes, which are in thousands of broken pieces and currently in storerooms.
